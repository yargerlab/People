# Jeff Yarger Public Folder on YargerLab GitHub Repository

Professor Jeff Yarger (jyarger@gmail.com) public open Yarger Research Group (yargerlab) repository.  Prof. Yarger also has a personal GitHub account and set of repositories at jyarger: https://github.com/jyarger/

This repo subfolder will be used for data, images, and general information related to research projects in the Yarger Research Group at ASU (and related collaborative research projects).

In general, the yargerlab general Data repo will be the default location for storing and sharing research data.  However, data that is more specific to Jeff Yarger and individual projects that don't involve any general group relevance will be included here, including data and information for individual lab notebooks and journaling.
